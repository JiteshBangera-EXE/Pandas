pandas.csv: This is a CSV file containing data on Pokémon. It includes columns such as No (Pokémon number), Name, Type1 (primary type), Type2 (secondary type, if any), Height, Weight, and Legendary (boolean indicating if it's a legendary Pokémon). The data covers the first 150 Pokémon from the original games, with attributes like Bulbasaur (Grass/Poison, 0.7m, 6.9kg) up to Mewtwo (Psychic, 2m, 122kg).

pandas.ipynb: This is a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of the Pandas library in Python. It covers topics like installing Pandas and NumPy, creating and manipulating Series (1D labeled arrays), DataFrames (2D tabular data), importing data from CSV files, data selection and filtering, aggregate functions (mean, sum, etc.), grouping data, and data cleaning techniques such as dropping columns, handling missing values, fixing inconsistent data, and converting data types. The notebook uses the Pokémon data from pandas.csv for examples.
